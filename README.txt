# BasiceCommercePage
Basic eCommerce Page for Assignment 1
# Basic eCommerce Page - Galway Supplements Hub
My project aims to make supplement brands from outside of Ireland more available to Irish consumers. The project contains a very simple eCommerce site. The site contains 9 named products all accompanied by a jpeg image. The project has some description in the footer and a hyperlink to an alternative website. 
# Installation
The project can be accessed through notebook++ or other such applications. The file can be unzipped to access the page and from there can be freely edited to your needs.
# Support
Support can be provided by contacting n.murphy59@nuigalway.ie, please allow 48-72 hours  for a response.
# Future additions
In the future i hope to update the aesthetic of the website. I also hope to develop the website so that the products can be viewed in better detail. 
# Contribution
Any contribution to aid the above aims would be greatly appreciated.
# Acknowledgements
I would like to acknowledge Nial O'Brolchain for providing the template to the project
